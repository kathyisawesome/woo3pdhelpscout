# Woo3pd Helpscout

Parse WooCommerce.com support emails into HelpScout conversations

## 1. Get HelpScout API credentials.

1. Go to your profile>My Apps and click "Create My App"
2. Copy App ID and App Secret.

You can set the Redirect URL to a dummy URL as it's not used.

## Option 1. Create a webhook App in Helpscout

1. Install the "Webhooks" app at https://secure.helpscout.net/apps/
2. This plugin only handles the "Conversation Created" webhook, so that's the only one you need to check.
3. Copy the Secret Key 
4. Set the callback URL to `http://yourwebsite.com/?woo3pd-api=helpscout`

5. On your website go to `Settings > Woo3pd Helpscout` and enter the App Id, App Secret, and Secret Key.

6. Set up an Email forwarder to automatically forward your WooCommerce.com support email to the private HelpScout email address.

## Option 2. SendGrid Inbound Parse

Inbound Parse means that SendGrid will be the MX record for all emails to a subdomain of your website. Example, `support@sendgrid.yourdomain.com` will be handled by SendGrid and sent to a webhook.

1. Verify your domain with SendGrid (requires adding CNAME records to your DNS). 
2. Add SendGrid's MX record to your DNS on a subdomain. 
3. Add the Inbound Parse rule in your SendGrid settings. See SendGrid's [Inbound Parse documentation](https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/parsing-email/setting-up-the-inbound-parse-webhook/).
4. Set the rule's delivery webhook to `http://yourwebsite.com/?woo3pd-api=sendgrid`
5. Get your Mailbox ID from HelpScout. Go to Manage > Mailboxes and the ID will be in the URL after mailbox: `https://secure.helpscout.net/settings/mailbox/XXXXX/`

6. On your website go to `Settings > Woo3pd Helpscout`, select SendGrid and enter the App Id, App Secret, and HelpScout Mailbox ID.
7. Change your WooCommerce.com store settings and set your support email to `support@sendgrid.yourdomain.com`. The username ie `support` can be pretty much anything as it's the subdomain that tells SendGrid to handle it.

## Minimum Environment
